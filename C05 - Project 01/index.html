            The objective of designing a site to ensure that when the users open the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that the user now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-brower), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which require careful planning on the side of the developer.
